# Todo-App
This is an Android demo application for helping users to record to-do items.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

Required: User can add items to the list
Required: User can delete items on the list by touching the item on the list for 2 seconds
Required: User can edit the itmes on the list by quick touch on the item

Notes:

Spent some time making the UI work across multiple phone resolutions by playing around with the RelativeLayout.
